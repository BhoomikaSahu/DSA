# Data Structure & Algorithm

## Array
*Array is a static linear data structure which stores similar type of data item stored at contiguous memory location.*

### Advantages:
- It allows random access to elements.
- It is fast to access.
- It is easy to implement.

### Disadvantages:
- It's size is fixed.
- Insertion and deletion is difficult to implement because it stores data in contiguous memory location and to do this we have to shift all the elements.

### Real Life Examples:
- The contact list in our phone represents the feature of array because when we add a new contact all the contacts shifts and the same thing happens when we delete a contact. 


## Linked List
*Linked List is a dynamic linear data structure which stores similar type of data items stored at random memory location and linked with each other through pointers. 
Due to its dynamic in nature the size is not fixed.*
    
### Advantages:
- It has dynamic size.
- We can easily insert and delete elements in it.

### Disadvantages:
- Random access of element is not allowed.
- Extra memory required for pointer.

### Real Life Examples-
- Image viewer uses linked list to link images with two buttons previous and next, with which we can move forward or backward.
